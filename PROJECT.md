## Implementation Details

### 1. Routing System
- Path-based navigation using state
- Component-based routing
- Responsive navigation design

### 2. API Integration
```typescript
// Open Library API Integration
const OPEN_LIBRARY_API = 'https://openlibrary.org';
async function searchBooks(query: string, page: number = 1) {
  const limit = 10;
  const offset = (page - 1) * limit;
  // API call implementation
}
```

### 3. State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Context Pattern Example
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_BOOKS':
      return {
        ...state,
        books: action.payload.books,
        totalBooks: action.payload.total
      };
    // Other cases
  }
};
```

### 4. Component Architecture
